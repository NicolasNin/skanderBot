Structur
The Markov class will handle the other. This class do 3 things:

- 1) take an input
--> this will give a liste of list of words (possibly only one list if this comes from a standalone text for ex)
- 2) generate token
---> this generate a dict of (keys: values) where values possibly multiples keys can be one word, or many, or it can use character if the input are charactere)
---> here we can add special token before each list to say that its the start that way we can start from this special token if we want good starting sentences
- 3)write ouput
--->different rules if we chose a random start or a particular token
